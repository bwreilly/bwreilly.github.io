Stay curious, [don't be afraid to look stupid](https://www.alexmolas.com/2023/09/18/embracing-dumbness.html)
- (e.g.: Willingness to look stupid by Dan Luu, How To Understand Things by Nabeel S. Qureshi, or Donâ€™t be Afraid to be wrong among many others)

Dive deep, lead from the front
- You stay late when they do

Organization values and mission are key    
- What we do
- Why we do those things (invest more or less in X)
- How we do them

Bilateral tranparency > shit umbrella
- Component of trust
- Best bosses I have had, I knew what their boss wanted of them, or the board, or the customers/partners when you are a senior exec

People choose to be led, and choose to follow
- Pulling rank means you have lost some trust

Always do 1:1s

Try to talk less

Support class simps need apply

Don't represent others unless they've been explict that is their wish
- "Trevor thinks"

Technical skills are considerably easier to learn than social/soft skills
- The latter are emotional and experiential (real practice can't be solo)

Have a possee for advice
