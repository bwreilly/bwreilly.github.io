The last crunch mode I experienced virtually none of the code could be salvaged. We did a reasonable review of the work and realized more than half would need to be significantly refactored.

It turns out that there has been some study around when a project should be rewritten vs. being subject to an extensive refactoring. It does depend, but generally the cut-off is about 20-25% – if you need to change more than that, you are likely better off just rewriting it ([Thomas, Delis, Basili, 1997](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~basili/publications/journals/J70.pdf)).
