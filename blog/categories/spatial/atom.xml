<h2>
The Problem &ndash; old data, important data</h2>
Some of the most important spatial data is old. It was built up and maintained over decades by paper and early computer systems, and it represents power lines, roads, water pipes, and property lines. It would be good to know the precise location of this stuff.
The PLC power system was designed on in-house drawn lotlines. Today, the difference between those lotlines and the actual parcel locations is as much as 100ft, and in no consistent direction. What follows are attempts to correct the location of more than 20,000 structures without doing a significant portion by hand, using some techniques picked up in Stanford&rsquo;s Free AI class.
<h2>
The correct location is the &ldquo;Hidden&rdquo; bit</h2>
Education in some very advanced and useful algorithms are now within the grasp of anyone with an internet connection and a decade old computer. More than a hundred thousand participated in the recently completed Stanford AI course, including myself. One particular technique caught my eye:
<iframe float="center" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/H0G1yslM5rc?rel=0" width="560"></iframe>
The problem being solved above is one of location &ndash; that is the hidden variable that needs to be estimated in continuous space. Why couldn&rsquo;t I do something similar for static assets like poles and underground vaults? With enough control points I could then move everything else relative to them (inverse distance weighted rubbersheeting) and vastly improve the data.
<h2>
A Naive Approach</h2>
I wanted to start with the simplest possible implementation. I loaded the lotlines (old, hand-drawn), parcel polygons, and the poles into PostGIS. I then converted the lines and polygons to points, and decided to use the total sum distance as the mechanism for comparing candidate particles to the poles.
Again, very naive (and the data is too noisy for it to work), but it served a purpose &ndash; getting everything set up for my next iteration: comparing candidates based on tangent and distance as the robot sensors above undoubtebly do.

It's been more or less done a while, but here is finally a blog post about it.</p>


<p>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/gallipoli/nx_spatial">nx_spatial</a> is a collection of addon functions for the <a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/index.html">networkx</a> python graph library. What can you do with it?</p>


<ol>
<li>Load GIS formats into <a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/introduction.html">networkx graphs</a> (where you can do all sorts of <a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/index.html">crazy analytics</a> on them)</li>
<li>Perform upstream and downstream traces with stopping points.</li>
<li>Set sources and find/repair edges that don't have the correct to/from nodes.</li>
</ol>


<p>
Example from the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/gallipoli/nx_spatial/wiki/Home">wiki</a>:</p>


<p><code>python
import nx_spatial as ns
net = ns.read_shp('/shapes/lines.shp')
net.edges() [[(1.0, 1.0), (2.0, 2.0)], [(2.0, 2.0), (3.0, 3.0)], [(0.9, 0.9), (4.0, 2.0)]]
net.nodes() [(1.0, 1.0), (2.0, 2.0), (3.0, 3.0), (0.9, 0.9), (4.0, 2.0)]
source = (2.0, 2.0)
ns.setdirection(net, source)
net.edges() [[(2.0, 2.0), (1.0, 1.0)], [(2.0, 2.0), (3.0, 3.0)], [(0.9, 0.9), (4.0, 2.0)]]
</code></p>

<p>
Available on <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nx_spatial/0.3dev">pypi</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/gallipoli/nx_spatial/wiki/Home">bitbucket</a>. Eventually I want to integrate it with networkx trunk (loading shapefiles is already in 1.4).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is old hat by now, but I love how much cruft can be killed by outright avoiding older APIs.<br/>
A unique location number needed to be generated for an engineering design tool. A vendor contact sent an example to work off that was about 400 lines of C# code. This little stored procedure replaced basically all of it.
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [sde].[IntersectGrid]
@x FLOAT, @y FLOAT
AS SET NOCOUNT ON
BEGIN</p>

<p>DECLARE @g geometry;
DECLARE @grid int;
SET @g = geometry::STPointFromText(&lsquo;POINT (&rsquo;+str(@x)+&lsquo; &rsquo;+ STR(@y)+&lsquo;)&rsquo;, 2);
SET @grid = (
  SELECT TOP 1 [areaName]
  FROM GridTable
  Where @g.STWithin(Shape) &lt;&gt; 0
 )
return @grid
END
```
How do you make this 400 lines? Easy, use the ArcObject API to do the intersect. Instantiating dozens of objects, checking out/in licenses, and using reflection to read a config file (not sure why they didn&rsquo;t just use AppSettings) adds up fast.
I could probably even do it with even less effort using <a href="http://trac.gispython.org/lab/wiki/Shapely">Shapely</a>, but no one else is really familiar with Python in this situation (vendors or coworkers).</p>
