I&rsquo;ve been hammering away at a GIS migration project that has been going  on far longer than anyone expected it might take, but I&rsquo;ve gotten the opportunity to hack away at some Python to more or less fix a problem I found on <a href="http://www.thegisforum.com/forums/t/7672.aspx">TheGISForum</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
I  currently have a geometric network that I&rsquo;ve been working with  using  the Utility Network Analyst tools. However, I&rsquo;ve been trying to  perform  a few tasks that I&rsquo;ve noticed the Network Analyst tools provide,  but  the Utility Network Analyst does not.
Specifically, I want to  place barriers at all locations specified by a  point feature class &ndash; a  functionality provided by the &ldquo;Add Locations&rdquo;  tool in the Network  Analyst Toolset.
Is there a way to use the network analyst tools  on a geometric network?</blockquote></p>

<p>The answer, sadly, is no. As far as I can tell, ESRI has not released any geoprocessing  tools for their Geometric Network.
But it is possible to roll-your-own  solution to get the same kind of tools by using existing open source  libraries. I have a <a href="http://bitbucket.org/gallipoli/utilitynetwork/">work-in-progress project</a> along these exact lines.</p>
